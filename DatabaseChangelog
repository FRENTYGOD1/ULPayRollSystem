# Database Module Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **Backup and Restore Path Handling**: Introduced the `getBackpath()` method to retrieve the backup directory path.
- **Backup Data Feature**: Added a `backupData()` method that retrieves the backup path and calls `BackupDataExtends()` to back up data.
- **Restore Data Feature**: Added a `restoreData()` method that retrieves the backup path and calls `RestoreDataExtends()` to restore data from backup.
- **CSV File Management**: Added options for users to select CSV files for adding or deleting data through a menu interface.

### Changed
- **Backup and Restore Method Signature**: 
  - Updated `BackupDataExtends()` and `RestoreDataExtends()` to accept the backup directory path as a parameter. This allows more flexibility in managing the backup locations.
  - Methods now directly call the `getBackpath()` function to get the backup path for operations.
- **UI Updates**: Enhanced the user interface with more prompts and feedback for users to easily navigate through data management options.

### Fixed
- **Error Handling**: Fixed issues where the backup or restore path was not being properly passed to methods, leading to errors during backup/restore operations.
