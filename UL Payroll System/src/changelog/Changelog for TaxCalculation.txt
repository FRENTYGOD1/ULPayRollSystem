### Changelog for `TaxCalculation` Class

#### Version 1.0.2
#### Date: 02/12/2024

- **Class created to handle tax calculations and salary display**:
  - **`calculateTax(double grossPay)`**:
    - Calculates the tax payable based on the provided gross pay.
    - The tax calculation is done using two tax rates:
      - **Low tax rate**: 20% for income up to €42,000.
      - **High tax rate**: 40% for income above €42,000.
    - Returns the total tax payable based on these thresholds.

  - **`displaySalaryDetails(String position, String scalePoint, String filePath)`**:
    - Displays salary details for a specific position and scale point.
    - Reads employee salary information from a CSV file.
    - For matching position and scale point, calculates the annual and monthly salary, monthly tax, and monthly net pay after tax.
    - Displays the following details:
      - Annual Salary
      - Monthly Salary (before tax)
      - Monthly Tax Deduction
      - Monthly Net Pay (after tax)
    - If no match is found, displays a message indicating that salary details were not found for the given position and scale point.

- **Error Handling**: Added exception handling for both **IOException** and **NumberFormatException** to handle cases where file reading or salary parsing fails.
